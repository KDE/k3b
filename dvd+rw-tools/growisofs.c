/*
 * growisofs 5.22 by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>.
 *
 * Use-it-on-your-own-risk, GPL bless...
 *
 * This front-end to mkisofs(8) was originally developed to facilitate
 * appending of data to ISO9660 volumes residing on random write access
 * DVD media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, as well as plain files/iso images.
 * At later stages even support for multi-session recording to DVD
 * write-once media such as DVD+R and DVD-R was added.
 *
 * As for growing random access volumes. The idea is very simple. The
 * program appends new data as it was added to a multisession media and
 * then copies the new volume descriptor(s) to the beginning of media
 * thus effectively updating the root catalog reference...
 *
 * For further details see http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/.
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * 1.1:
 * - flush cache before copying volume descriptors;
 * 2.0:
 * - support for /dev/raw*;
 * - support for set-root-uid operation (needed for /dev/raw*);
 * - support for first "session" burning (needed for "poor-man");
 * - "poor-man" support for those who don't want to recompile the
 *   kernel;
 * 2.1:
 * - mkisofs_pid typo;
 * 2.2:
 * - uninitialized in_device variable;
 * - -help option;
 * 3.0:
 * - support for DVD+R;
 * 3.1:
 * - -Z fails if a file system is present and stdin is not a tty;
 * 3.2:
 * - support for image burning (needed for DVD+R as you can't use dd);
 * 3.3:
 * - 'growisofs -Z /dev/scdN image.iso' is too confusing, implement
 *   'growisofs -Z /dev/scdN=image.iso' instead;
 * 4.0:
 * - transport C++-fication for better portability;
 * - support for -dvd-compat option (improved DVD+R/RW compatibility);
 * - -dvd-video implies -dvd-compat;
 * - support for SONY DRU-500A;
 * - progress indicator for -Z /dev/scdN=image.iso;
 * - agressive -poor-man-ing;
 * 4.1:
 * - uninitialized errno at exit from -Z /dev/scdN=image.iso;
 * 4.2:
 * - don't print initial bogus progress indicator values;
 * - apparently some firmwares exhibit ambiguity in DVD+R disc
 *   finalizing code;
 * 5.0:
 * - enforced 32K write strategy (needed for DVD-R[W]);
 * - support for DVD-RW Restricted Overwrite Mode;
 * - support for DVD-R[W] Sequential Mode;
 * 5.1:
 * - support for writing speed control;
 * 5.2:
 * - re-make it work under Linux 2.2 kernel;
 * - progress indicator to display recording velocity;
 * - code to protect against overburns;
 * - undocumented -use-the-force-luke flag to overwrite the media
 *   none interactively;
 * - brown-bag bug in "LONG WRITE IN PROGRESS" handling code fixed;
 * 5.3:
 * - Pioneer workarounds/fix-ups, most notably DVR-x05 doesn't seem
 *   to digest immediate "SYNC CACHE";
 * - support for DVD-RW Quick Format, upon release verified to work
 *   with Pioneer DVR-x05;
 * - bug in DVD+RW overburn "protection" code fixed;
 * - media reload is moved here from dvd+rw-format;
 * - refuse to burn if session starts close to or beyond 4GB limit
 *   (limitation of Linux isofs implementation);
 * - dry_run check is postponed all the way till the first write;
 * 5.4:
 * - split first write to two to avoid "empty DMA table?" in kernel log;
 * - setup_fds is introduced to assist ports to another platforms;
 * - set-root-uid assistant code directly at entry point (see main());
 * - OpenBSD/NetBSD support added, it's worth noting that unlike 3.3
 *   port by Maarten Hofman, it's /dev/rcd?c which is expected to be
 *   passed as argument, not /dev/cd?c.
 * 5.5:
 * - fix for ENOENT at unmount, I should have called myself with execlp,
 *   not execl;
 * - security: chdir("/") in set-root-uid assistant;
 * - use /proc/mounts instead of MOUNTED (a.k.a. /etc/mtab) in Linux
 *   umount code;
 * 5.6:
 * - unconditional exit in set-root-uid assistant, mostly for aesthetic
 *   reasons;
 * - support for DVD-RW DAO recordings (whenever Pioneer-ish Quick
 *   Format is not an option, DAO should fill in for it, as it's the
 *   only recording strategy applicable after *minimal* blanking
 *   procedure);
 * - support for SG_IO pass-through interface, or in other words
 *   support for Linux 2>=5;
 * - 'growisofs -M /dev/cdrom=/dev/zero', this is basically a counter-
 *   intuitive kludge assigned to fill up multi-session write-once
 *   media for better compatibility with DVD-ROM/-Video units, to keep
 *   it mountable [in the burner unit] volume descriptors from previous
 *   session are copied to the new session;
 * - disable -dvd-compat with -M option and DVD+R, advice to fill up
 *   the media as above instead;
 * - postpone Write Page setup all the way till after dry_run check;
 * - if recording to write-once media is terminated by external event,
 *   leave the session opened, so that the recording can be resumed
 *   (though no promises about final results are made, it's just that
 *   leaving it open makes more sense than to close the session);
 * - ask unit to perform OPC if READ DISC INFORMATION doesn't return
 *   any OPC descriptors;
 * - get rid of redundant Quick Grow in Restricted Overwrite;
 * - Solaris 2.x support is merged, it's volume manager aware, i.e.
 *   you can run it with or without volume manager;
 * 5.7:
 * - Solaris USB workaround;
 * - 15 min timeout for FLUSH CACHE in DVD-RW DAO;
 * - revalidate recording speed;
 * - load media upon start-up (Linux used to auto-close tray upon open,
 *   but not the others, which is why this functionality is added so
 *   late);
 * 5.8:
 * - elder Ricoh firmwares seem to report events differently, which
 *   triggered growisofs and dvd+rw-format to end-less loop at startup
 *   [event handling was introduced in 5.6 for debugging purposes];
 * - int ioctl_fd is transformed to void *ioctl_handle to facilitate
 *   port to FreeBSD;
 * - FreeBSD support contributed by Matthew Dillon;
 * - volume descriptors from second session were discarded in
 *   Restricted Overwrite since 5.6;
 * 5.9:
 * - some [SONY] firmwares make it impossible to tell apart minimally
 *   and fully blanked media, so we need a way to engage DAO manually
 *   [in DVD-RW]... let's treat multiple -dvd-compat options as "cry"
 *   for DAO;
 * - refuse to finalize even DVD-R media with -M flag (advise to fill
 *   it up with -M /dev/cdrom=/dev/zero too), apparently DVD-units
 *   [or is it just SONY?] also "misplace" legacy lead-out in the same
 *   manner as DVD+units;
 * - oops! DAO hung at >4MB buffer because of sign overflow;
 * - couple of human-readable error messages in poor_mans_pwrite64;
 * - work around Plextor firmware deficiency which [also] manifests as
 *   end-less loop upon startup;
 * 5.10:
 * - increase timeout for OPC, NEC multi-format derivatives might
 *   require more time to fulfill the OPC procedure;
 * - extended syntax for -use-the-force-luke option, it's now possible
 *   to engage DVD-R[W] dummy mode by -use-the-force-luke=[tty,]dummy
 *   for example, where "tty" substitutes for the original non-extended
 *   option meaning, see the source for more easter eggs;
 * - FreeBSD: compile-time option to pass -M /dev/fd/0 to mkisofs to
 *   make life easier for those who mount devfs, but not fdescfs;
 * - eliminate potential race conditions;
 * - avoid end-less loop if no media was in upon tray load;
 * - interpret value of MKISOFS environment variable as absolute path
 *   to mkisofs binary;
 * - to facilitate for GUI front-ends return different exit codes, most
 *   notably exit value of 128|errno denotes a fatal error upon program
 *   startup [messages worth popping up in a separate modal dialog
 *   perhaps?], errno - fatal error during recording and 1 - warnings
 *   at exit;
 * - to facilitate for GUI front-ends auto-format blank DVD+RW media;
 * - Linux: fix for failure to copy volume descriptors when DVD-RW
 *   Restricted Overwrite procedure is applied to patched kernel;
 * - FreeBSD: growisofs didn't close tray upon startup nor did the rest
 *   of the tools work with open tray;
 * - bark at -o option and terminate execution, the "problem" was that
 *   users seem to misspell -overburn once in a while, in which case it
 *   was passed down to mkisofs and an iso-image was dumped to current
 *   working directory instead of media;
 * - generalize -M /dev/cdrom=file.iso option, but if file.iso is not
 *   /dev/zero, insist on sane -C argument to be passed prior -M and
 *   double-verify the track starting address;
 * 5.11:
 * - authorship statement in -version output;
 * - make speed_factor floating point and print "Current Write Speed"
 *   factor for informational purposes;
 * - Pioneer DVR-x06 exhibited degraded performance when recording DVD+;
 * - Pioneer DVR-x06 failed to complete DVD+ recording gracefully;
 * - alter set-root-uid behaviour under Linux from "PAM-junky" to more
 *   conservative one;
 * 5.12:
 * - single Pioneer DVR-x06 user reported that very small fraction of
 *   his recordings get terminted with "LONG WRITE IN PROGRESS," even
 *   though growisofs explicitly reserves for this condition... It
 *   turned out that at those rare occasions unit reported a lot of free
 *   buffer space, which growisofs treated as error condition. It's not
 *   clear if it's firmware deficiency, but growisofs reserves even for
 *   this apparently rare condition now.
 * - [major] issue with MODE SENSE/SELECT on SANYO derivatives, such as
 *   Optorite, is addressed;
 * - Linux can't open(2) a socket by /dev/fd/N, replace it with dup(2);
 * - more relaxed command line option parsing and simultaneously a
 *   zealous check to make sure that no mkisofs options are passed
 *   along with -[ZM] /dev/cdrom=image;
 * - report I/O error if input stream was less than 64K;
 * - -M /dev/cdrom=/dev/zero didn't relocate the lead-out in DVD-RW
 *   Restricted Overwrite;
 * 5.13:
 * - workarounds for Panasonic/MATSUSHITA DVD-RAM LF-D310;
 * - Solaris: media load upon start-up;
 * 5.14:
 * - LG GSA-4040B failed to auto-format DVD+RW blanks;
 * - '| growisofs -Z /dev/cdrom=/dev/fd/0' failed with "already carries
 *   isofs" even when running interactively, so I check on /dev/tty
 *   instead of isatty(0);
 * - error output was confusing when overburn condition was raised in
 *   dry-run mode;
 * - more sane default drain buffer size to minimize system load when
 *   unit fails to return usable buffer utilization statistics under
 *   "LONG WRITE IN PROGRESS" condition;
 * - progress indicator process was orphaned if -Z /dev/cdrom=file.iso
 *   terminated prematurely;
 * - -overburn -Z /dev/cdrom=file.iso printed two "ignored" messages;
 * - Solaris: use large-file API in setup_fds;
 * - HP-UX: HP-UX support is contributed by HP;
 * - block signals in the beginning of recording, formally it shouldn't
 *   be necessary, but is apparently needed for some units (is it?);
 * - prepare code for -speed even in DVD+ context, need a test-case...
 * - TEAC DV-W50D and Lite-On LDW-811S failed to set recording velocity,
 *   deploy GET PERFORMANCE/SET STREAMING commands;
 * - Lite-On LDW-811S returns 0s in Write Speed descriptors in page 2A,
 *   this would cause a problem if DVD+ speed control was implemented;
 * 5.15:
 * - confusing output when DAO mode is manually engaged and DVD-RW media
 *   is minimally blanked;
 * - complement -use-the-force-luke=dao[:size] to arrange for piping
 *   non-iso images in DAO mode (size is to be expressed in 2KB chunks);
 * - Pioneer DVR-x06 apparently needs larger timeout to avoid "the LUN
 *   appears to be stuck" message in the beginning of DAO recording;
 * - HP-UX: fix-up umount code;
 * - HP-UX: make sure user doesn't pass /dev/rscsi/cXtYlZ, they should
 *   stick to /dev/rdsk/cXtYdZ;
 * - implement -use-the-force-luke=seek:N -Z /dev/dvd=image to arrange
 *   for 'builtin_dd if=image of=/dev/dvd obs=32k seek=N/16' (note that
 *   N is expected to be expressed in 2KB chunks);
 * - skip overwrite check for blank media to avoid read errors at start,
 *   which reportedly may cause bus reset in some configurations;
 * - make get_mmc_profile load media, explicit media load used to be on
 *   per platform basis, while it doesn't have to;
 * - postpone handle_events till after dry-run checkpoint;
 * - error reporting revised;
 * - Optorite seems to insist on resuming suspended DVD+RW format, at
 *   least it's apparently the only way to get *reliable* results
 *   (formally this contradicts specification, which explicitly states
 *   that format is to be resumed automatically and transparently);
 * - FreeBSD: FreeBSD 5-CURRENT since 2003-08-24, including 5.2 fails
 *   to pull sense data automatically, at least for ATAPI transport,
 *   so I reach for it myself (it's apparently a kernel bug, which
 *   eventually will be fixed, but I keep the workaround code just in
 *   case);
 * - -speed option in DVD+ context is enabled, upon release tested with
 *   Plextor PX-708A;
 * - make builtin_dd print amount of transferred data, together with
 *   -use-the-force-luke=seek:N it's easier to maintain "tar-formatted"
 *   rewritable media;
 * 5.16:
 * - brown-bag bug in "LONG WRITE IN PROGRESS" code path;
 * 5.17:
 * - Linux: fix for /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/check_media set to 1;
 * - HP-UX: INQUIRY buffer is required to be 128 bytes. Well, "required"
 *   is wrong word in this context, as it's apparently a kernel bug
 *   addressed in PHKL_30038 (HPUX 11.11) and PHKL_30039 (HPUX 11.23).
 *   This "change" affects all dvd+rw-tools, but I don't bump their
 *   version numbers for this, as it's an "ugly" workaround for an
 *   *external* problem;
 * - switch to GET PERFORMANCE even for current write speed (most
 *   notably required for NEC and derivatives);
 * - the above change required adaptations for Pioneer and LG units,
 *   which don't/fail to provide current write speed through GET
 *   PERFORMANCE despite the fact that the command is mandatory;
 * - HP-UX: retain root privileges in setup_fds, SIOC_IO requires them;
 * - fix for COMMAND SEQUENCE ERROR in the beginning of DVD-recording;
 * - drop privileges prior mkisofs -version;
 * 5.18:
 * - refuse to run if ${SUDO_COMMAND} is set;
 * - minimize amount of compiler warnings on 64-bit platforms;
 * - skip count-down if no_tty_check is set;
 * - -use-the-force-luke=tracksize:size option by suggestion from K3b;
 * - Linux: fix for "Bad file descriptor" with DVD+RW kernel patch;
 * 5.19:
 * - IRIX: IRIX 6.x port is added;
 * - Solaris: get rid of media reload, which made it possible to improve
 *   volume manager experience as well;
 * - address speed verification issues with NEC ND-2500 and Plextor
 *   PX-708A;
 * - make DVD-RAM work in "poor-man" mode;
 * - average write speed report at the end of recording;
 * - LG GSA-4081B fails to "SET STREAMING" with "LBA OUT OF RANGE" for
 *   DVD+RW media, but not e.g. DVD-R;
 * 5.20:
 * - DVD-RAM reload if recorded with -poor-man;
 * - -use-the-force-luke=wrvfy for WRITE AND VERIFY(10);
 * - "flushing cache" takes forever, from 5.19-1;
 * - HP-UX: inconsistency between /dev/rdsk and /dev/rscsi names;
 * - handle non-fatal OPC errors;
 * - DVD+R Double Layer support;
 * - -use-the-force-luke=4gms to allow ISO9660 directory structures
 *   to cross 4GB boundary, the option is effective only with DVD+R DL
 *   and for data to be accessible under Linux isofs a kernel patch is
 *   required;
 * - more sane sanity check for -use-the-force-luke=tracksize:N;
 * - -use-the-force-luke=break:size to set Layer Break position for
 *   Double Layer recordings;
 * - speed verification issue with 8x AccessTek derivatives addressed;
 * - -use-the-force-luke=noload to leave tray ejected at the end;
 * - allow to resume incomplete sessions recorded with -M option;
 * - Layer Break position sanity check with respect to dataset size;
 * - #if directive to get rid of sudo check at compile time with
 *   'make WARN=-DI_KNOW_ALL_ABOUT_SUDO';
 * 5.21:
 * - Linux: fix for kernel version 2.6>=8, 2.6.8 itself is deficient,
 *   but the problem can be worked around by installing this version
 *   set-root-uid;
 * 5.22:
 * - fix for DVD+R recordings in Samsung TS-H542A;
 * - TODO: increase priority;
 * - TODO: 4x is [intentinally] treated as 1x;
 * - TODO: http://lists.debian.org/cdwrite/2004/10/msg00045.html
 * - DVD-R Dual Layer DAO and Incremental support;
 * 5.22-k3b:
 * - Applied patch to retry close session.
 * - Added buffer status (very simplistic, should be reworked before release)
 * - Added lazy option (for now default) which makes growisofs ignore some error
 *   like failed speed change or an opc error.
 * - raise priority of the process
 * - growisofs is installed suid root
