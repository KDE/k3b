<para>If you have used a burning program such as Nero under Windows, &k3b; will feel quite familiar.
</para>
<para>Featuring a simple, yet powerful graphical interface, &k3b; provides various options for burning a CD, DVD, or BD (Blu-ray disc). Various types of optical projects are supported including (but not limited to) audio and data, video projects for DVD and VCD, as well as multi-session and mixed-mode discs. &k3b; also has the ability to erase re-writeable media and can perform more complicated tasks such as audiovisual encoding and decoding.

Git commit 127d389fe61c77225eb8efab0c53ddf2ef704fdf by Michal Malek.
Committed on 11/09/2011 at 17:56.
Pushed by mmalek into branch 'master'.

Moved K3bSetup functionality to K3b's config dialog

K3bSetup never really belonged to SystemSettings. When user wanted
to change device or programs permissions he'd needed to switch to
SystemSettings which was not obvious. Hence this settings were moved
to K3b settings window. Program permissions can now be changed in a new
"Permissions" tab on "Programs" section.
Modification of devices permissions has been removed altogether. In
all (?) modern systems optical devices belongs to a certain user group
(e.g. "cdrom"). If the current user does not belongs to this group,
he's offered to add himself to it in "Devices" section of K3b settings
window.

FEATURE: 220040
FIXED-IN: 2.1.0
GUI: K3bSetup no longer exists

Commit log is wrong here, this is FIXED-IN:2.0 branch

<para>When you run &k3b; for the first time, you may find &k3b; informing you that no optical writer drivers have been found, meaning you will not be able to write to any optical discs. There is no need to panic as &k3b; will open the <guilabel>Permissions</guilabel> tab on the <guilabel>Programs</guilabel> page of the configuration dialog, where permissions can now be changed. In
all modern systems optical devices belongs to a certain user group (&eg; <quote>cdrom</quote>). If the current user does not belongs to this group, he is offered to add himself to it on this tab.

<chapter id="preparing-to-burn-a-disk"><title>Preparing to burn a disk</title>
<para>When starting a new project, you should ensure that &k3b; has detected the correct optical media, such as CD or DVD. On the status line at the bottom of the screen you should see the size of disk which is currently set. If this is not correct, or you require a different size, simply right-click on it and set the preferred size from the provided list:

</para>
<para>Now choose what is to be burnt.
</para>
<para>The top half of the screen is the <emphasis>source pane</emphasis>; it functions like a file manager. You can choose ordinary files from mounted data volumes or audio tracks from inserted audio discs. Names of audio tracks are automatically read from CD-Text data, if your CD drive supports reading it, or generated using <ulink url="http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/">CDDB</ulink>; the exact format is controlled by a button in the bottom pane. If the names are incorrect or simply do not match the description of the disc, you can edit them using the toolbar button. Your changes will be cached locally and submitted to the master registry at <ulink url="http://www.freedb.org/">FreeDB</ulink>.
</para>
<tip>
<para>If the whole record is performed by the same artist, leave the track artist entries blank, fill the <guilabel>Album artist</guilabel>, save to CDDB and requery.
</para>
</tip>
<para>Now that you have your sources at hand, simply drag and drop the files and directories you wish to burn onto the large pane to the right at the bottom; this is the <emphasis>model pane</emphasis>. Behold a tree of your chosen files forming to the left. Should there be some files or directories which you do not want to burn, these can be easily removed from the project by simply removing them from the panel at the bottom. Select the file to be removed (you can control-click to select multiple ones), then choose <guilabel>Remove</guilabel> from the context menu. 
</para>
<tip>
<para>If you need to compress audio, create a new audio CD project, add the files to be converted and press the button <guilabel>Convert Tracks</guilabel>. This will not affect the contents of the CD if you decide to burn it; however, you will be able to use the compressed files elsewhere. Make sure the original files are lossless (<emphasis>wav</emphasis> or <emphasis>FLAC</emphasis>), otherwise the result will be unsatisfactory.
</para>
</tip>
<para>The top line will be the title of the disk. In many cases this will be fine, but if you would like to change this to something else, simply rename it using the context menu.
</para>

</para>
<para>You will see on my screenshot that no disk was present. When you have inserted the appropriate disk you will see a description of it on that line.
</para>
<para>There are still one or two choices to be made. I would <emphasis>recommend</emphasis> that you set <guilabel>Verify written data</guilabel>, then hit the <guilabel>Save</guilabel> icon at the bottom of the screen, ensuring that it becomes your personal default. For most modern drives it's safe to leave mode and speed to <guilabel>Auto</guilabel>. If you may wish to burn another copy of the disk at a later date, select <guilabel>Create image</guilabel>, which will save having to set up the burn again. Set the number of copies you want to burn, then, when you are satisfied, hit <guilabel>Burn</guilabel>.
