      K3b was created to be a feature-rich and easy to handle CD burning
      application. It consists of basicly three parts:
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects: Projects are created from the file menu and then filled with
      data to burn.
      The Tools: The tools menu offers different tools like CD copy or DVD
      formatting.
      Context sensitive media actions: When clicking on the Icon representing a
      CD/DVD drive K3b will present its contents and allow some further action.
      This is for example the way to rip audio CDs.
